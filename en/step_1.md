Thonny allows you to change the theme and font of the software. This feature means that you can increase the font size and change the background and text colours to suit your needs. 

To change the theme and font: 

+ Click on Tools -> Options.

+ Click on the 'Theme & Font' tab. 

+ Click on the drop down boxes for each option until you find the settings that best suit your needs.

+ Press OK when you are finished.

**Warning**: Stick to simple, clean fonts. Using a handwriting style font will make your code much harder to read and debug.
